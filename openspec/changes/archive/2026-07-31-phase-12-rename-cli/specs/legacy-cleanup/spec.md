## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: project.md migration hint

The system SHALL preserve project.md and display a migration hint instead of deleting it.

#### Scenario: project.md exists during upgrade

- **WHEN** `openspec/project.md` exists during legacy cleanup
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT delete the file
- **AND** the system SHALL display a migration hint in the output:
  ```
  Manual migration needed:
    → openspec/project.md still exists
      Move useful content to config.yaml's "context:" field, then delete
  ```

#### Scenario: project.md migration rationale

- **GIVEN** project.md may contain user-written project documentation
- **AND** config.yaml's context field serves the same purpose (auto-injected into artifacts)
- **WHEN** displaying the migration hint
- **THEN** users can migrate manually or use `/otrix:explore` to get AI assistance
