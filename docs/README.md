# Warpweave Documentation

Welcome. This is the home for everything Warpweave.

Warpweave helps you and your AI coding assistant **agree on what to build before any code is written.** You describe the change, the AI drafts a short spec and a task list, you both look at the same plan, and then the work happens. No more discovering halfway through that the AI built the wrong thing.

If you read nothing else, read these two pages:

1. [Getting Started](getting-started.md): install, initialize, and ship your first change.
2. [How Commands Work](how-commands-work.md): where you actually type `/ww:propose` (hint: in your AI chat, not the terminal). This trips up almost everyone once.

That second one matters more than it looks. Warpweave has two halves: a command line tool you run in your terminal, and slash commands you give to your AI assistant. Knowing which is which saves you the most common moment of confusion.

> **The best habit to build first: when you're not sure what to build, start with `/ww:explore`.** It's a no-stakes thinking partner that reads your code, weighs options, and sharpens a fuzzy idea into a concrete plan before any artifact or code exists. The [Explore First](explore.md) guide makes the case.

## Pick your path

**I'm brand new.** Start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md), then skim the [Core Concepts at a Glance](overview.md). When something feels mysterious, the [FAQ](faq.md) and [Glossary](glossary.md) are nearby.

**I have a problem but not a plan.** This is the common case, and it has a dedicated answer: [Explore First](explore.md). Use `/ww:explore` to think it through with the AI before committing to anything.

**I have a big existing codebase.** You don't document all of it. [Using Warpweave in an Existing Project](existing-projects.md) shows how to start on real, brownfield code without boiling the ocean.

**I just want to get it working.** [Install](installation.md), run `warpweave init`, then read [How Commands Work](how-commands-work.md) so your first slash command lands in the right place. Or hand the setup to your assistant with the [AI-assisted install prompt](installation.md#install-with-your-ai-assistant).

**I learn by example.** The [Examples & Recipes](examples.md) page walks through real changes start to finish: a small feature, a bug fix, a refactor, an exploration.

**The AI just drafted a plan — now what?** Read it. [Reviewing a Change](reviewing-changes.md) shows the two-minute pass that catches a wrong turn while it's still cheap, and [Writing Good Specs](writing-specs.md) covers what a plan worth approving is made of.

**I work on a team.** [Warpweave on a Team](team-workflow.md) shows how a change maps onto a branch and a pull request, and how teammates review a plan before the code.

**I'm coming from the old workflow.** The [Migration Guide](migration-guide.md) explains what changed and why, and promises your existing work is safe.

**I want to bend it to my team's process.** [Customization](customization.md) covers project config, custom schemas, and shared context.

**Something's broken.** [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) collects the failures people actually hit, with fixes.

## The thirty-second version

```text
1. Install        npm install -g warpweave@latest
2. Initialize     cd your-project && warpweave init
3. Explore        (in your AI chat)  /ww:explore           ← optional, but a great habit
4. Propose        (in your AI chat)  /ww:propose add-dark-mode
5. Build          (in your AI chat)  /ww:apply
6. Archive        (in your AI chat)  /ww:archive
```

Steps 1 and 2 happen in your terminal. The rest happen in your AI assistant's chat. That split is the one thing worth memorizing, and [How Commands Work](how-commands-work.md) explains exactly why. Step 3 is optional, but starting with `/ww:explore` when you're unsure is the habit most worth forming.

## Where else to get help
